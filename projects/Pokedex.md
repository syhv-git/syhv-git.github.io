This programing project was the final homework assignment for ICS 212 at the University of Hawai\`i at Manoa. This was my favorite assignment in the course, as it had a fun concept, and was the most comprehensive assessment of C++. The final project for the course was actually a bit tamer in terms of C++ procedures, and I think this code demonstrates my coding style and abilities better. Also, we completed the final project prior to the last homework, and did not learn some data structures such as vectors. I enjoyed learning C and C++, and these languages helped me branch my personal research into new languages.

The main concept for this homework assignment was utilizing the vector structure to create a database of Pokémon. This database functions the same as a Pokémon Pokédex. This program can also be further enhanced with more defined Pokémon and Pokémon stats/attack abilities, and potential for single monitor duels is possible, but it would require a bit of programming and manipulation of the Pokémon objects. The project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/syhv-git/pokedex).
