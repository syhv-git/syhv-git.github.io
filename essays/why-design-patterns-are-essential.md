When developers create programs, they use other software like packages and libraries to enhance their developments without working through additional problems. Furthermore, these solutions are optimized so that the developers do not need to reinvent the wheel on common computational issues. The reason why these application frameworks are so important is that they are based on design patterns. Design patterns can be defined as a solution that has been optimized, tested, and proven to solve common problems in highly portable ways. 

Design patterns are templates that allow developers to fill in the gaps to conform to their unique project requirements. Another way to think of this is using templates for Geometric shapes in mathematics and art. While creating a shape without a template is not difficult, creating a perfect square or circle would take a lot of unnecessary time to solve. The same idea is present in software development. Design patterns are solutions to problems not already built into the programming language. So, they expand the capabilities of the language for any software development project.

These problems may be commonalities, but they are often quite complex. For example, LISP is one of the most low-level languages, and it would be very tedious to create software without the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). Also, the built-in lambda function is a software design pattern that falls under the strategy pattern. The strategy pattern allows the developer to select a function at runtime. As such, the lambda function creates a runtime function to serve as the bridge to more complex computations.
