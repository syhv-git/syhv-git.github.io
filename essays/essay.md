When learning a new programming language, the software one develops is usually very basic and does not use all the capabilities of the language. Most coding languages follow the same logical framework, so jumping in to software development is usually straightforward. However, it could take many hours of work to create something that resembles the same complexity as regularly distributed software. This is where application programming interfaces, APIs, and user interface frameworks come into play. These are libraries where some developer or group of developers use their proficient skillset of a language to build an easy to learn and implement toolkit to enhance a beginner's experience and software. These packages often do the hard calculations and manipulation required to perform complex computations and allow the programmer to complete tasks with ease. These libraries help programmers with tasks that have already been optimized so they do not have to 'reinvent the wheel' every time they want to learn a new language, and can even help with learning the structure and functionality of the language as a whole.

## Work smarter, not harder

When it comes to UI frameworks and APIs, the most important thing to do is learn what they do and why they do it. This can be done by reading supplied documents and reading the source code.
