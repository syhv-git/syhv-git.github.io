Throughout most of my beginner courses in Information and Computer Science, I often thought being a programmer was simply being able to write a program. Especially with my focus on cybersecurity, I often thought that I would not need to know how to engineer software. There are databases filled to the brim with tools for cybersecurity and my naïve self, thought it would be enough to just utilize the software already created. What I did not understand is, knowledge of software engineering can help to enhance the learning process of new tools, and modify or create tools for problems I want to overcome. While being able to write a program is fundamental, being a career-level programmer requires much more than fundamentals.

Understanding programs from a software engineer’s perspective can help to identify the functionality and capabilities of a program. Understanding other programmers' code is crucial for not only helping other people’s projects but also for working in a group environment. Software engineering can serve as a way to unify understanding, and expedite the project’s timeline. Furthermore, everyone has different knowledge and background, and one person can create connections in unique ways, which may not be clear to another. This can create innovation, and new perspectives on problems.

Through the course, ICS 314, I hope to establish stronger skills in comprehension of programing languages, efficient and effective problem-solving skills, and better logistical format of my code. I also hope this course will help me better understand software design in concurrent and future courses, as well as my career. For the field of cybersecurity, there are numerous programs developed, however, many of these programs are obsolete in terms of real-world defense and attacks against expert hackers. Most, if not all, expert security specialists and hackers create their own software, to either reinforce or deconstruct a system's defenses.
