When learning a new programming language, the software one develops is usually very basic and does not use all the capabilities of the language. Most coding languages follow the same logical framework, so jumping in to software development is usually straightforward. However, it could take countless hours of work to create something that resembles the same complexity as regularly distributed software. This is where application programming interfaces, APIs, and user interface frameworks come into play. These are libraries where some developer or group of developers use their proficient skillset of a language to build an easy to learn and implement toolkit to enhance a beginner's experience and software. These packages often do the hard calculations and manipulation required to perform complex computations and allow the programmer to complete tasks with ease. These libraries help programmers with tasks that have already been optimized so they do not have to 'reinvent the wheel' every time they want to learn a new language, and can even help with learning the structure and functionality of the language as a whole.

## Work smarter, not harder

When it comes to UI frameworks and APIs, the most important thing to do is learn what they do and how they do it. This can be done by reading supplied documents and reading the source code. New programmers often find learning the syntax of external libraries to be extra work; however, the processes used are advanced implementations of the language, and can help to further ones comprehension of the language. Reading the source code can develop a deeper grasp on how they can manipulate the language, and how to use the library as a tool to enhance their own ideas. Reading the source code can also help increase capabilities and potentially lead the programmer to create their own libraries in the future.

## Where these tools fall short

Learning the tools of a framework can often feel like learning a new language, and in many cases, it is like learning a new language. The programmer must learn how to use the library and when it is meant to be used. This is exactly like any programming language, as they all have different structures and applied functionality. Comprehensive knowledge of what language to use for certain tasks is a must to prevent wasting valuable time. Furthermore, programmers may feel that frameworks hinder the stylistic and optimization capabilities of their software. These libraries often require strict manipulation of data through the language, and as developers become more advanced in their software, they may feel limited by the tools supplied to them. However, this could also stem from inadequate understanding of how the library implements the language and may be easily overridden in some circumstances. Furthermore, one could opt to use the tools in some areas and create their own processes for others, but this requires an expert understanding of how the library works and how to implement their own procedures flawlessly.

## Concluding thoughts

Using UI frameworks and APIs is essential to all programming languages. For newcomers, using libraries already created is the most efficient way to start coding like a pro. Even career professionals use libraries; however, the professionals tend to write the libraries themselves for specific tasks they want to accomplish. These packages are tools programmers utilize to make work easier and redundancy to a minimum. After all, carpenters and other craftsmen do not smash nails into wood with rocks, they use hammers and tools made for the job. They also have extensive knowledge of what tools are most effective for different tasks and utilize them all to their full potential.
