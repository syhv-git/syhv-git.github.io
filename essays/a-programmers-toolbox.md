When learning a new programming language, the software one develops is usually very basic and does not use all the capabilities of the language. Most coding languages follow the same logical framework, so jumping into software development is relatively straightforward. However, it could take countless hours of work to create something that resembles the same complexity as regularly distributed software. This is where user interface frameworks and other packaged libraries come into play. These are software files where some developer or group of developers use their proficient skillset of a language to build an easy-to-use and implement toolkit to enhance a beginner's experience and software development. These packages complete the intricate calculations and data manipulation required to perform complex computations and allow the programmer to complete tasks efficiently. These libraries contain maximally optimized functions, so programmers do not have to 'reinvent the wheel' every time they want to learn a new language. Frameworks can even help with understanding the structure and functionality of the language as a whole.

## UI Frameworks, libraries, and application programming interfaces (APIs)

There are many types of supplemental software one can download, and they can all seem similar at first. The lowest level tool is a library. This contains functions and operations to enhance and reduce the code in a developer's software. Developers can implement them individually or in a package of libraries and act as additional options to choose from. An API is a set of libraries that allow independent software to interact with other programs to provide enhanced functionality. APIs are useful to enable a software's portability and to use programs to expedite additional software development. A framework is a specific set of APIs designed to accomplish a task efficiently and effectively. Frameworks can be thought of as a skeleton where the programmer fills in the empty spaces to create software. Frameworks are meant to be used across the entire program and give the developer structural guidelines to develop advanced software quickly. An analogous way to think about these is a craftsman's tools. Something like nails is the library that allows pieces of wood to come together, a nailgun would be an API to expedite the process of joining two pieces of wood, and a framework is an entire toolbox used to build something. 

## Work smarter, not harder

When it comes to UI frameworks and APIs, it is essential to learn what they do and how they do it. This can be done by reading supplied documents and reading the source code. New programmers often find learning the syntax of external libraries to be extra work; however, the processes used are advanced implementations of the language and can help further one's comprehension of the source language. Reading the source code can develop an extensive grasp of how they can manipulate the language and use the library as a tool to enhance their ideas. Reading the source code can also help increase one's capabilities and guide the programmer to create their own libraries in the future.

## Where these tools fall short

Learning the tools of a framework can often feel like learning a new language, and in many cases, it is like learning a new language. The programmer must learn how to use the library and when it is meant to be used. This is precisely like any programming language, as they all have different structures and applied functionality. Comprehensive knowledge of what language to use for specific tasks is a must to prevent wasting valuable time. Furthermore, programmers may feel that frameworks hinder the stylistic and optimization capabilities of their software. These libraries often require strict manipulation of data through the language, and as developers become more advanced in their software, they may feel limited by the tools a framework provides. However, some procedures can be overridden to exhibit their ideas. Furthermore, one could use the tools in some areas and create their processes for others, but this requires an expert understanding of how the library works and how to implement their procedures flawlessly.

## Concluding thoughts

Using UI frameworks and APIs is essential to all programming languages. For newcomers, using libraries already created is the most efficient way to start coding like a pro. Even career professionals use frameworks and APIs; however, they tend to write the libraries themselves for specific tasks they want to accomplish. These packages are tools programmers utilize to make work easier and redundancy to a minimum. After all, craftsmen do not smash nails into wood with rocks. They use tools made for tasks to make their work enjoyable. They also have extensive knowledge of the most effective tools for different jobs and utilize them to their full potential.
